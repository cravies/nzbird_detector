# Downloading, augmenting and labelling data

- First download OpenLabelling
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cartucho/OpenLabeling
```
- Move the files from /label/ into the OpenLabeling repo /OpenLabeling/main
- Now get the csv of birds you want to scrape and download from the macaulay library.
- I already have some in the repository. 
- You have to make an account to download big csv.
- Edit the download_birds.py to include these csv.
- Now to download those bird images run 
```bash
make all
```
- This downloads the files, splits them into train,test,val folders, and runs augmentation 
to increase the size of the dataset. 
- Now we move them to the OpenLabelling directory
```
make move
```
- Now change to the openlabelling directory and label some training images with
```
make tr
```
- Label testing images with
```
make te
```
- Label validation images with
```
make v
```

# Training model 
- Download the ipynb file bird_YOLO_v3.ipynb
- Upload this file to colab to run
- Compress your train,test,val folders (including "out" label folders) in a folder called 'bird_data'. Upload it to your google drive
- Note: the train folder will need to be compressed otherwise it will be too large.
- Put the train and train_out folders into a zip folder named 'trains' inside 'bird_data'
- Run all in the ipynb. It should take 2+ hours to train(with premium) more with free colab
- Note: colab will need permission to grab the data from your drive
- You can see the saved results on video and image tests in your drive

Note: 
The results of the model is quite dependent on the hyperparameters conf_thresh (confidence bounding box threshold).
Setting a lower confidence threshold makes the model more sensitive and leads to false positives. 
Conversely, setting a high confidence threshold makes the model insensitive and leads to false negatives.
To get good results before deploying,you should tweak this hyperparameter.
The best value will depend on the type of data you input. When the model runs it outputs a ROC curve that shows you false positive/ negative rates at different confidence thresholds. You can use the optimal value as the default if you don't feel like tweaking it for different scenarios.
